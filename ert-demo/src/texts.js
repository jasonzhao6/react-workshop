      Sometimes when I watch shows like Passengers, and they’re experiencing
      intergallactic travel, slingshotting around a star and gazing at it out
      the window, or standing outside the ship staring into the universe, I get
      actually angry that I won’t experience it. Time to find a religion that
      believes we can create worlds and travel from one to the other.
